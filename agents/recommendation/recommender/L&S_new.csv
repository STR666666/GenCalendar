"Short stories are quick bursts of storytelling, which, much like a short film or a music video, capture an intense burst of feeling, a fleeting mood, a scene of transformation.  Or else, you might say they operate like slow motion: they arrest a moment or slice of time, they attend to its nuances and the forces that buffer it, and they ask us to attend to them with extra care.  Short stories often show how moments that might appear very ordinary to most of us can in fact be momentous, utterly transformative, for somebody.  In this, for modern, humdrum, everyday lives, they can provide a kind of modernist sublime. In this class, we will read a cross-section of short stories, from classic to contemporary, from America and the world."

"A cornerstone of criticism and interpretation is the question of meaning in text, whether a novel, poem, or play... or indeed, in any cultural text, whether an advertisment, campaign speech, or news article, et cetera.  This course explores how we can apply this search for meaning and this process of interpretation to computers, software, and code. What is the plain, subtle, or hidden meanings in the source code of a digital story or a video game? For that matter, what about in the code of a computer virus, a space shuttle, or a predictive policing algorithm?

ENGL    150. Anglo-Irish Literature
(4) STAFF Prerequisite: Writing 2 or 50 or 109 or English 10 or upper-division standing.
"This course considers how a series of wishes, lies, and dreams, and about the Irish were invented and read. Ireland, like California, is a territory on the western edge of a continent about which many mythologies have grown up.  In Ireland's case, these mostly have to do with the supposed mystery of the place, its romance and mythic past, or its violence, or its long bitter history. Who invented these versions of the place, and whose interests do they serve? Why do people continue to believe them? How have they changed? We consider how one small country has been imagined as """"other"""" - as wild, strange, dangerous, fanatic - and how the Irish in their literature, speak back. In Irish literature, they reinvent Irishness."

"Many geographic, social, and natural systems involve dynamic processes or movement of individuals in space and time. Examples include animal migration, human mobility, disease diffusion, and natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.  Movement is key to understanding these dynamic processes. This course reviews computational methods for analysis, modeling and simulation of movement in ecological and human systems.  Students gain an understanding of spatiotemporal processes and patterns, and develop computational skills to process trajectory data, analyze movement patterns, and apply movement models. Through a final capstone project, students study a spatiotemporal problem in depth and write a research paper."

How did African political cultures and enslaved black aspirations for freedom came together to shape America? The American revolution is often heralded as ending monarchy and establishing a republican form of government-but it was roughly contemporaneous with two other revolutions, one in West Africa, the other in Haiti-that were incredibly important in shaping ideas about freedom and good government at the end of the 18th century. Black people brought more than toil; they brought revolutionary ideas, beliefs, and practices that profoundly shaped modernity. Understanding Africa, we will see, is important to understanding America."

(4) PEREZ
"Our objective is to (re-)materialize religion by focusing on things and feelings. We approach the religious sensorium as made up not only of sight, scent, sound, taste, and touch, but also emotions,sentiments, and intensities of affect. We consider the bodies formed by religious disciplines and technologies, through contact with the  ?stuff? (objects, spaces, and media) of everyday ritual practice and performance. Readings survey contemporary theoretical and social scientific scholarship on religious perception, sensation, and subjectivity. We examine the ?mind-body problem?; the construction of sensory categories; and the influence of sensory hierarchies on  formations of race/ethnicity, gender/sexuality, and class in religious contexts."

We look at Amerindian cultures, Big Game hunting in colonial Africa, Fernando Pessoa's heteronyms, and environmental imaginary in contemporary cinema. We explore how the arts can shape environmental thinking, raise awareness of non-human lifeworlds, and provide cultural responses to the growing climate crisis."

"(4) MOSER, THOMAS"
Enrollment Comments: Open to non-majors.
"This online course - presented as an adventure game - introduces students to the art and archaeology of Rome, with assignments that focus on writing and the research process. The course asks students to determine whether or not a collection of ancient objects from an American museum should remain in the US or be sent back to Italy. Throughout the course, students excavate artifacts at a digital dig site, visit museums, explore Roman monuments, and navigate the shadowy world of the tombaroli (tomb robbers) and mafia-run black market for antiquities."
