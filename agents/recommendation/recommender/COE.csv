                        This course represents a comprehensive foundation for core ECE topics in signal processing, image  analysis, machine learning, optimization and control. The lectures present concepts from linear  algebra, such as matrix computations, systems of linear equations, eigenspace decomposition,  inner-product, orthogonality, least-squares and linear regression. Students actively engage with the technical materials with an introduction to Python programming and associated hands-on sessions. The materials are be motivated by real-world scenarios ranging from medical imaging to autonomous  vehicles, from (miscarriage of) justice to brain-machine interfaces, from music analysis to GPS design.

                        This course represents a comprehensive foundation for core ECE topics in signal processing, image  analysis, machine learning, optimization and control. The lectures present concepts from linear  algebra, such as matrix computations, systems of linear equations, eigenspace decomposition,  inner-product, orthogonality, least-squares and linear regression. Students actively engage with the technical materials with an introduction to Python programming and associated hands-on sessions. The materials are be motivated by real-world scenarios ranging from medical imaging to autonomous  vehicles, from (miscarriage of) justice to brain-machine interfaces, from music analysis to GPS design.

                        Introduces students to the important role of engineering   calculations    in product design. This   will be accomplished through detailed case       studies that   show how   fundamental physics and   engineering are        applied to scope the performance of   engineering   prototypes. This will  also show   how prototype shape emerges from a combination of   customer   requirements and what is feasible   within the constraints of time,        budget, physics and the   current state   of technology.

                        Modeling and translation into practical FEA using SolidWorks simulation tools. The course focuses on choosing the correct constraints for parts and assembly. Another focus is on moving parts within SolidWorks. If time permits the class considers optimization of mechanical structures based on anticipated loads. This class goes through the cycle of designing, performing FEA, testing and repeat. SolidWorks, including its geometry optimization module, is used in this class as a ""calculator"". This fulfills the need of industry (SolidWorks), while preparing students to Capstone and other courses.

                        This course introduces engineering design with a focus on an iterative design process. Throughout the course, a group project cements the topics learned through active application to a real design problem. The lectures are broken into three sections.  Section 1 introduces a version of this iterative Design Cycle, which comprises four components: 1) Define, 2) Ideate, 3) Prototype & Test, and 4) Analyze. These steps are repeated many times over the course of design development, not always in this order. Section 2 of the course focuses on applying this Design Cycle to the team project. Section 3 wraps up and focuses on presenting the project.

                        Introductory course to the processes of pattern formation   and self-      organization in natural systems (physical and biological   systems), as    well   as in engineering. The goal of the course is to explain   how       ordered   spatial structures appear in different systems. We will          discuss the common   aspects and the differences in the mechanisms that    establish the patterns,   and introduce various techniques used in         different   disciplines to study   the formation of spatially extended     structures.
