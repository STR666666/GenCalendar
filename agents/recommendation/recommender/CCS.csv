                        The mathematics of group theory is introduced.  Point groups and symmetry  operations will be applied toward the normal coordinate analysis of        molecular vibrations and the construction of molecular orbitals from       symmetry adapted linear combinations of atomic orbitals.

                        Students write creative pieces--stories that are more or less based on their experiences using fictional techniques such as dialog and scenes. The course is the workshop so attendance is very important. Students write a piece for the various topics that are presented weekly and discuss stories anonymously in class. Students also write short critiques and do in class writing assignments.
